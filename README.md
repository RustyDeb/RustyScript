# Rusty script

This is a forge 1.8.9 mod Hardstone nuker's chest solver will now use server side rotations (toggle-able) Added multiple config options to enderman macro:

Enderman Move Macro Enderman Lobby Randomization Right Click Mode Zealot Only Lobby Swap Timer Shifting / Right Click Speed Ironman Mode: This will store all the items u get from enderman macro in a chest on your island instead of selling to bazaar Stuck detection Added a new feature: Big Dungeons Blocks, under the "Dungeons" category, it'll change all chests, levers, buttons, wither essences and redstone keys to 1x1x1 blocks

Added a racism blocker to /Rusty -> Filter with 3 different modes (this is not meant to block ALL racism, just a few common phrases and bypasses)

Custom name peek is now a toggle instead

RoseGoldAddons no longer uses timechanger modid, but instead it's own modid (that's hidden from the server)

Minor improvements to DungeonESP

# IMPORTANT Rusty NO LONGER USES SCROLLABLE TOOLTIPS. It has its own mod ID which is hidden from the server. If you need scrollable tooltips, download the mod from sk1er here.

The best skyblock mod. Open settings with keybind or /Rusyt.

# Notable Changes

Left click leap to door opener Clear sight improvements No block animation

# New Features:

Custom keybind item macros (Macros Tab)! Image of how the config looks included below. I do not recommend binding a left click macro to left click as it is basically attacking twice in the same frame Custom Mod ID hider (Misc Tab) Custom blacklist for no block animation features (Misc Tab) Toggle right click to AFK stun Thorn (Dungeons Tab) Bug Fixes:

Box ESP style should no longer bug out Terminals should be more consistent ESP now works with Patcher's entity culling. More FPS
